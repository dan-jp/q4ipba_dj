<h3 class="h33"> What is Sitio Bebe?</h3>
<br>

<p class="p1"> Sitio Bebe is a small community that is experiencing a lot of problems inside their community, such as health care issues, lack of medicine, water shortages, and more. In order to help them, we are organizing a fundraiser, which we will hold at a concert. The profits that we will receive will be donated or used to help Sitio Bebe. Our concert will feature performances by Silent Sanctuary, December Avenue, Orange, and Lemons, so we welcome your support in our fundraiser or by simply spreading this information.
